# ML Project - Student Performance Prediction

This project focuses on predicting student performance using machine learning techniques. The project involves data ingestion, data transformation, model training, and evaluation. The project is organized into various components, scripts, and notebooks.

## Project Structure

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd MLprojects

2. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Project Components

Data Ingestion: Responsible for loading and preprocessing the data from the source.
Data Transformation: Transforms the data into a suitable format for model training.
Model Training: Trains machine learning models using the prepared data.
Prediction Pipeline: Handles prediction tasks using trained models.
Logging: Tracks execution progress and errors during script execution.
Exception Handling: Custom exception classes to improve error management.
